# RW GENERAL AUTOMOTIVE & TIRE SERVICES
## Website Analysis and Redesign Plan

---

# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

## Current Website Weaknesses
- **Limited Self-Service Functionality**: No online appointment booking, quote request system, or tire finder tool
- **Shallow Content Depth**: Service pages lack detailed descriptions, warranties, process explanations, and staff credentials
- **Missed SEO Opportunities**: Minimal local SEO optimization, no schema markup, limited keyword targeting beyond basic service names
- **Conversion Barriers**: Users must call for most information; no instant gratification for common tasks (pricing estimates, appointment scheduling)
- **Content Gaps**: No FAQ section, blog, or educational content to capture organic search traffic
- **Trust Indicators**: Limited display of certifications, partnerships, guarantees, or comprehensive reviews

## New Website Primary Goals
1. **Increase Online Conversions**: Enable 24/7 appointment booking and quote requests
2. **Establish Authority**: Position RW as the trusted local automotive expert through content and credentials
3. **Dominate Local Search**: Optimize for "auto repair Douglasville GA" and related high-intent keywords
4. **Reduce Friction**: Answer common questions and provide transparent pricing before customer contact
5. **Mobile-First Experience**: Ensure seamless functionality across all devices for on-the-go users
